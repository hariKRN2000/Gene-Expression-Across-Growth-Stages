This folder contains the files used for sensitivity analysis 
The files Sensitivity_analysis_degtag.ipynb and Sensitivity_analysis_no_degtag.ipynb are two jupyter notebooks used for generating the sensitivity matrices (SSMs) using the Bioscrape toolbox 
These notebooks export the SSMs as a numpy datafile
The file Sensitivity_matrix_analysis.ipynb shows how to extract data from the datafile and export it for plotting purposes 
For more information on the sensitivity analysis and the toolbox, you can read about the tool at : https://github.com/biocircuits/bioscrape/blob/master/examples/Sensitivity%20Analysis%20using%20Bioscrape.ipynb
