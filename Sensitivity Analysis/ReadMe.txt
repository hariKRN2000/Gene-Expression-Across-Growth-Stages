This folder contains the files used for sensitivity analysis 
The files Sensitivity_analysis_degtag.ipynb and Sensitivity_analysis_no_degtag.ipynb are two jupyter notebooks used for generating the sensitivity matrices (SSMs) using the Bioscrape toolbox 
These notebooks export the SSMs as a numpy datafile
The file Sensitivity_matrix_analysis.ipynb shows how to extract data from the datafile and export it for plotting purposes
