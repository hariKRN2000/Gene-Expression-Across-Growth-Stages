### File Information: 

This folder contains the notebook used to generate the phase diagrams to examine the effect of parameter pertubation on protein dynamics. <br> <br>
-- SBML files contains the BioCRNpyler generated model files used for simulations <br> <br>
-- The file Phase_diagrams.ipynb has all the lines of codes to explain the whole process <br><br>
-- simulation_results contains the .svg images of the phase diagrams of interested exported by the notebook. <br> <br>
-- Parameters.py contains the definition of a class named Parameters. This class allows for the creation and management of multiple parameters, each with its value, lower bound, and upper bound. The parameters are stored as a collection within the class. The parameter values can be exported as a dictionary or a CSV file, and the parameters can also be imported from a CSV file to recreate the parameter instances with their specified bounds.  <br> <br>

-- Parameter_class_implementation.ipynb is a notebook to demonstrate how to use the Parameter.py utility
