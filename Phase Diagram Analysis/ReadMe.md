### File Information: 

This folder contains the notebook used to generate the phase diagrams to examine the effect of parameter pertubation on protein dynamics. <br> <br>
-- __SBML_files__ : Contains the BioCRNpyler generated model files used for simulations <br> <br>
-- __Phase_diagrams.ipynb__ : Generates the phase diagrams <br><br>
-- __simulation_results__ : Contains the .svg images of the phase diagrams of interested exported by the notebook. <br> <br>
-- __parameters.py__ :  Contains the definition of a class named Parameters. This class allows for the creation and management of multiple parameters, each with its value, lower bound, and upper bound. The parameters are stored as a collection within the class. The parameter values can be exported as a dictionary or a CSV file, and the parameters can also be imported from a CSV file to recreate the parameter instances with their specified bounds.  <br> <br>

-- __Parameter_class_implementation.ipynb__ : A notebook to demonstrate how to use the Parameter.py utility
