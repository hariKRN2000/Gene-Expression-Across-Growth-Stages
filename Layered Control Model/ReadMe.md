### File Information: 
Here, we applied the GEAGS framework and simulated the dynamics of 4 constructs with different feedback strategies as described in the publication: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33058-6 ('Layered feedback control overcomes performance trade-off in synthetic biomolecular networks') <br> <br>
-- __layered_control_equations__ : Contains the ODEs in a python file used to run the layered control model. <br> <br>
-- __layered_control_main__: Runs the ODEs from layered_control_equations.py and plots all the required plots for the publication figure <br> <br>
-- __experiment_data__ : Experiment data from previously published paper <br> <br>
-- __lcm_param_file_042025.csv__ : Model parameters in csv file
