## This folder contains the three effective models that are used in the paper 
The files named: <br>
(1) Effective_model_equations.py  <br>
(2) Effective_CRN_hybrid_model_1_equations.py  <br>
(3) Effective_CRN_hybrid_model_2_equations.py  <br>
Are the files with the ODE models and contain all the model equations. They are the model building files  <br>  <br>  <br>

The files named:  <br>
(1) Effective_model_implimentation.ipynb  <br>
(2) Effective_CRN_hybrid_model_1_implimentation.ipynb  <br>
(3) Effective_CRN_hybrid_model_2_implimentation.ipynb  <br>
Are the file that loads the models and runs them, compares them with the experimental data  <br>  <br>

The files names:  <br>
(1) Effective_model_param_file.csv  <br>
(2) Effective_CRN_hybrid_model_1_param_file.csv  <br>
(3) Effective_CRN_hybrid_model_2_param_file.csv  <br>
Are the parameter arrays that can be loaded to run the models  <br>  <br>

simulation_run_data_720min_deg.csv and simulation_run_data_720min_no_deg.csv are the output from CRN, truncated to the first 720 minutes for our observation 

Effective_model_comparison.ipynb loads all the run data from all the models and compares them with the CRN and the experimental data
