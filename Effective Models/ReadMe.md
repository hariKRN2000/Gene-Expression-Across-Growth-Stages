## This folder contains the three effective models that are used in the paper 
The files named: 
(1) Effective_model_equations.py
(2) Effective_reduced_model_equations.py
(3) Effective_CRN_hybrid_model_equations.py
Are the files with the ODE models and contain all the model equations. They are the model building files 

The files named: 
(1) Effective_model_implimentation.ipynb
(2) Effective_reduced_model_implimentation.ipynb
(3) Effective_CRN_hybrid_model_implimentation.ipynb
Are the files with the LMFIT parameter objects to show how to run the models and tune their parameters using the LMFIT object 

The files names: 
(1) Effective_model_param_file_072924.csv
(2) Effective_reduced_model_param_file_072924.csv
(3) Effective_CRN_hybrid_model_param_file_072924.csv
Are the parameter arrays that can be loaded to run the models

GEAGS_run_data_720min_deg.csv and GEAGS_run_data_720min_no_deg.csv are the output from CRN, truncated to first 720 minutes for our observation
